This folder implementes the algorithm to select a set of linear inequalities from the H-Representation of a set of points.

[cipher_Inequalities.txt] ---This txt file contains the H-Representation of a given set of points, which is actually a set of linear inequalities returned by Sage software. Sage returns a linear inequality with the form $$$(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)\cdot x^{T} + b >= 0$$$, this linear inequalty will be stored within a single line in cipher_Inequalities.txt with the form $$$(a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n, b)$$$. The cipher_Inequalities.txt presented here contains all the linear inequalities among the H-Representation of the division trails of TWINKLE Sbox with each line representing a single inequality.

[cipher_Reduced_Inequalities.txt] ---This file contains the reduced inequalities.
